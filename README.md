# maven-space-challenge

I partcicpated and accepted the Maven Analytics challenge to test my analysis skills by analyzing Space data from 1957 - 2022. 
I conducted the analysis to understand all space missions through out the period. 

Using the code in the repo, I tried to gain insights into the data and conduct analysis like:

- The highest number of exploration each year;
- The country with the highest number of expl;oration andd their success rate;
- The company with the highest number of missions;
- The space rocket with the highest number of missions and their success rate;
- The overall number of missions each year;
- The succes rate of all the missions;
- The amount of money spent on all missions;
- The number and percentage of active rockets.

With the above analysis, I was able to understand more of the data and come up with insigths.
